# What is Javascript?
 JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. It was invented by Brendan Eich.
 
 ## JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
 
  - Writing into an HTML element, using **innerHTML.**
  - Writing into the HTML output using **document.write().**
  - Writing into an alert box, using **window.alert().**
  - Writing into the browser console, using **console.log().**

## What is a variable? 
 A variable is a container that is used to store/hold the value *eg. **let age =20;**
