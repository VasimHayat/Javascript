# What is Javascript?
 JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. It was invented by Brendan Eich.
 
 ## JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
 
  - Writing into an HTML element, using **innerHTML.**
  - Writing into the HTML output using **document.write().**
  - Writing into an alert box, using **window.alert().**
  - Writing into the browser console, using **console.log().**

## How to Use JavaScript in HTML ?
 - 1. Inline JavaScript 
    *eg.*  **```  <button onclick="alert('hi')">Click</button>   ```**
 - 2. Internal JavaScript, with the script tag
   *eg.*  
   **```  
        <script>
        function(){
            alert("I am inside a script tag")
        }
       </script>
    
    ```**

## What is a variable? 
 A variable is a container that is used to store/hold the value *eg. **let age =20;**
